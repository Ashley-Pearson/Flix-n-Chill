# Flix-n-Chill


## User Story

```
As a frequent movie-watcher I want to be given a random title to watch and a random cocktail recipe to make and  enjoy during my film so that I donâ€™t waste 20 minutes trying to choose. I want options to choose a movie genre and a choice of a cocktail ingredient. I also want a surprise option to have the app choose a random movie and a random cocktail for me.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN an application that allows me to search for a movie and cocktail recipe
WHEN I select a genre from the drop-down menu 
THEN I am presented with a movie from the genre I chose
WHEN I select an ingredient from a drop-down menu
THEN I am presented with a cocktail recipe that includes the ingredient I chose
WHEN I select "Surprise Me" from the movie and cocktail drop-down
THEN I am presented with a random movie and cocktail recipe
```
